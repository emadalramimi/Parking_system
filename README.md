# Parking System Project

This project presents a comprehensive Parking System designed to manage parking lots efficiently. Utilizing Ada programming language, this system facilitates vehicle entry and exit record management, parking slot allocation, and provides an interactive menu for both parking lot administrators and vehicle owners.

## Project Overview

The Parking System is developed to streamline the operations of parking lots, ensuring optimal utilization of space, enhancing security, and improving overall user experience. The system is capable of handling multiple parking lots, supports various types of vehicles, and includes features like:

- **Dynamic Parking Slot Allocation**: Automatically assigns parking slots based on vehicle size and availability.
- **Real-time Availability Tracking**: Keeps track of occupied and available slots in real-time.
- **Vehicle Management**: Registers vehicle entry and exit, calculating parking fees based on the duration of stay.
- **Reporting**: Generates reports on daily parking activity, earnings, and occupancy rates.
- **User Menu**: Offers an intuitive interface for users to interact with the parking system.
